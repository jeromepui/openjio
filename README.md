## Who are we?

We are **Jerome Pui Qixun** and **Hng Shan Hern**, coming Year 2 Computer Science students (as of AY22/23) from the **National University of Singapore**. This project was developed for **CP2106 - Independent Software Development Project (Orbital)** by our team, **OpenJio!**, at the Apollo 11 level of achievement under the guidance of our adviser, Nicholas Lowie.

## Motivation

In todayâ€™s digital age, shopping online has risen in popularity, especially during the pandemic. Many shopping platforms often have bundle deals or deals that require high minimum spending for free delivery, especially for overseas purchases.

As practical consumers, we want to enjoy these shopping deals without buying more than we need or shelling out too much for delivery fees. Consumers who cannot find friends or family members to share the deal with would have to look for other consumers interested in the same deal. What if we created an application to help connect these consumers? Such a platform would augment the search process for consumers interested in the same deals. Consumers would be able to communicate with other interested consumers regarding the transaction and select trustworthy consumers to join them for the deal.
